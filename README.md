## Food is wasted even before it gets into the hands of consumers.

Through a dataset given by iTradeNetwork, we were able to see just how much produce was wasted in a relatively short time period.

Half a million cases of strawberries were thrown out of only 6 million. That's a whopping 8 percent.

And yet, nothing was done about it. lmperfect seeks to revolutionize the agricultural status quo. Just like how our name uses an 'l', the produce that we want to bring to consumers can be a little unorthodox. However, we more than make up for it in terms of quality. We hope to allow the consumer to be able to take in the products that had to be thrown away. Bananas aren't bad after they go brown, they can be turned into banana bread. The FDA rejects produce with slight imperfections, e.g. an orange being a bit too oval, not allowing them to be sold to supermarkets because of merely aesthetic reasons. Through lmperfect - we allow consumers like you to reap the benefits of discounts while maximizing farmer profits by integrating this service into the producer trade and supply network.
